## Quickstart (Windows)

a. Open Windows Command Prompt and Install Git using `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`  

b. Create folder to download Git Repository and initialize git with `git init` in the CMD 

c. Pull repo with ` git pull https://github.com/soto-sergio/ecst_intrv_v2.0.git`  

d. Install miniconda using  `winget install -e --id Anaconda.Miniconda3`  

e. Create environment variables  

> conda env create -f environment.yml  
> conda activate eduenv  

## Steps

1. Download ChromeDriver if using Google Chrome as web browser. [Link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) 
- Install and keep `chromedriver.exe` in the project's folder. [Not required. Driver already included]

2. The program requires you to download your Homeroom Roster as follows:
- Go to Frontline SIS (TEAMS). 
- Click on `Enter Classroom Grading` > Select your Homeroom class > Reports > Class Student Listing with Addresses (Excel)
- Save the roster inside the the project's folders `data/raw/`  

  IMPORTANT: Keep the name of the file as it is `ClassStudentListingwithAddresses`. Save as type: `Microsoft Excel Worksheet`.  
  If you are updating an older roster, make sure the name is saved exactly as mentioned.   

3. Run the script in the Command Prompt by typing `python ecst_main.py`  


## NOTES
>
> * IMPORTANT: Make sure the Reading intervention was created before the Math one. You can always change the date to make it appear first. 
> * Amount of minutes of each intervention entry is set to 30. Changing it seems to produce an error.
